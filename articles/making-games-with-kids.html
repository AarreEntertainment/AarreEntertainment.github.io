<h1>Five ways how I have been able to make a game in my free time with two children</h1>
<b>December 24, 2016</b> <i> AarreEntertainment </i>
<p>I’m almost 35, I have two small kids and I am about to release my first game. It’s Christmas eve while I’m writing this, my 3 year old daughter is watching cartoons from an old android tablet and my 1.5 year old son is doing his best to stop me from effectively writing this post. This post is mostly about finding time where there is none, and getting things done when it is seemingly impossible.
</p>
<p>I come from a development background which helps me to actually finish projects instead of being in a loop of perfectionism and procrastination. It’s not really about good code, quite the contrary, my number one rule is
</p>
<h3>Write bad code that simply works</h3>
<p>
You can fix it afterwards. That is the main difference between projects that have reached their goal and vaporware. Vaporware never reaches the finished stage. Remind yourself that you’re not a large studio with an army of coders who can each focus in building beautiful functions. However, this can kill your project if you don’t follow the second rule.
</p>

<h3>Keep your projects small and split larger ones</h3>
<p>If you are planning to do a larger project, build a game around a core mechanic. Rinse and repeat. You might not make a dime off it, but you’ll still have a mechanic to re-use in a larger project and you’ll keep interest in the large one as it feels smaller. Aarre is my first game, so it’s very unlikely that I will re-use any elements from it in later games, as my methods have evolved throughout the process.</p>

<h3>Write code and make audio design when you are alone, do graphics and level design while the kids are around.</h3>
<p>This is something I realized after a few days, that you can’t focus on writing any code while someone is hanging on your sweater asking for snacks or to put on a Paw Patrol DVD. Audio requires the parent’s most occupied sense, the hearing, so that is also mostly a no go during the daytime.</p>

<h3>Include your children</h3>
<p>Toddler games are mostly uninspiring, but there are several ways you can put your kids to use in game design. I have co-designed Aarre with my daughter who has made many of the textures used in the game and comes up with ideas for the zones which either are or will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heart valley (finished upon release)</li>
<li>TV remote world (nearly finished upon release, will come in a month)</li>
<li>The south pole (in its initial stages upon release, will come soon)</li>
<li>Space world</li>
<li>Tiny people world</li>
<li>Emoji world</li>
<li>Toilet paper world</li>
 </ul>

<h3>Don’t make money your first priority</h3>
<p>I’m making a free mobile game with reward multiplier video ads. It’s very likely I won’t make any real money from it, and I won’t let it ruin my fun from making quirky little games, which hopefully brings even a small shard of the enjoyment I have gotten from making them.</p>
