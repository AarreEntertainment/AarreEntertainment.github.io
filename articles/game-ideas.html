<h1>Testing your game idea in five ways</h1>
<i>December 25, 2016</i> <b>AarreEntertainment</b>

I tend to think that there is no such thing as an initially good idea for a game. Even seemingly terrible ideas and in the most extreme, buggy hackathon accidents, become viral hits and great games, such as Goat Simulator and My Summer Car. I get two to three game ideas daily, which get scrapped by the end of the day as I test them. As we cross the river Styx, we need to ask:
</p>
<h3>Does the idea spark excitement?</h3><p>
You might have an idea which you think that will sell, but if it doesn’t excite you, I very much doubt it will ever become a finished project. Even if it will, an idea which only exists to make money but doesn’t inspire you, will make most of us cut corners in places where it will hurt the game. And don’t get me started on procrastination. The best thing that can happen during the development of an uninspiring idea, is another, exciting game.
</p>
<h3>Is the idea doable?</h3><p>
Say you’re a one man team like I am. I’m pretty certain that Assassin’s Creed and No Man’s Sky mashup MMO with material mining is never going to happen. Think mechanics, think world building, think content creation. THINK CONTENT CREATION. Say you want some deer in the background. You’ll likely model a nice little deer in four or five hours. No deer mocap in the Unity Asset Store. Shit. Let’s go to youtube. Animating and rigging animals. Next thing you know you’ll spend a good week making a background element run frame by frame using some David Attenborough video as reference, thus pushing the release further because you didn’t touch the code for a week.
</p>
<h3>Does it include costs?</h3><p>
Is it multiplayer? Developing multiplayer games has its testing phase, which translate to cloud costs. Do you need additional software licenses? Do you need to use real money to buy assets? That great deer mocap data costs $100, how many units do you have to sell to patch that? Do you need to buy equipment, a Kinect, HTC Vive or a Macbook to build on iOS?
</p>
<h3>Is it a remake of something you have played?</h3><p>
Because that train’s a very crowded one. There are several indie studios and developers actively researching the entire recorded history of gaming for ideas, and others are already executing them, and some Russian guy just uploaded 17 games with the same idea but with a car or a cat or an ostrich or a sandwich as the playable character to the Google Play Store.
</p>
<h3>Does it fit your brand?</h3><p>
Here lie many good ideas. Is it worth making another sub-brand for? You’ve made a name for yourself in action games and now you want to celebrate being a new parent by making a toddler game for Android. Where should I put this studio logo, which is a stylized exploding zombie head? If you REALLY want to do it, you’re ready to make another brand and leverage it with your current followers, or in some cases build a completely new following.

Here’s the trailer again.
